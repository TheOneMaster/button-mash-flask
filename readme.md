# Button Mash
A website for the button mash game built using Flask. The game can be played at <https://button-mash.onrender.com/game>. However, since the game is being run on a free server, it may take upto half-a-minute for the server to be spun up.

# How to play
The game itself is a fairly simple mashing game. Once loaded into the page, the settings can be viewed by clicking on the settings wheel. All players (upto a max of 4) who wish to join must be in the same room (viewable in the settings panel).

Once all players are in the room, click on the start game button to begin. Once all players in the room have clicked the button, the game begins. Once the blinking text saying `waiting...` disappears, begin mashing.

***The mashing key is spacebar.*** The game lasts for 10 seconds and the score is measured in clicks-per-second.

The winner of the game is represented by the one who has the green bar. 

## TODO
- Finish website HTML and CSS
- Add Profile page for logged in users
- Create homepage with game data and leaderboard
- Create graphs for users
- Replay system for previous games
- Allow key choice for mashing
- Allow gamepad native input for mashing (probably restrict room selection by input type)
